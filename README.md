# RiskCredit
## Overview
The goal of this research project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict a customer's ability to repay loans. The model will be trained on historical loan data, which will be used to identify patterns and trends that can help predict a customer's creditworthiness. The model will incorporate various features such as income, employment history, credit score, and other relevant financial indicators to generate a prediction.
